This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting seismic events on Mars. By analyzing sensor data collected by NASA and stored in the Mars InSight Seismic Data 
repository, we will create a machine learning model capable of identifying anomalies indicative of seismic activity. In the first stage of the project, a Jupyter Notebook was 
developed to consolidate the diverse data sources into a unified dataset suitable for machine learning.

Below are screenshots showing some sections of the Jupyter notebook

For some sensors I found it interesting to graph the density of data distribution

Finally I made a list of the points that were pending.

Following the development of an appropriate machine learning model, we will proceed to integrate it into a web application to provide a user-friendly interface for data visualization.
